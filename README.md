# SharpSlicer
A C# .NET Core implementation of [Mojang's slicer](https://github.com/Mojang/slicer)

## Usage
Usage is the same as its Java counterpart.
`<input dir or zip> <output dir> [<leftover dir>]`

### Why?
Educational purposes. I wanted to try converting something from Java to C# <br/>
There is no real benefit to using this over Mojang's unless you happen to have .NET Core installed but not Java.
